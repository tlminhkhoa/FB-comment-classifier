Linda Smallwood,1.62404E+14,"Bath & Body Works , Well... since you asked. Before my Husband, and I went in the store i had a budget of $125.00 which i was okay with since i only needed a few soaps, and of course body wash, lotions, and sprays (not to mention hand Sanitizers) As i started loading up the bags with, Cherry Blossom, boardwalk taffy,  fiji, belize, waikiki, love & sunshine. Gingham (spray sanitizer) 5 small hand sanitizers, and two bee happy soaps.  My total was $181, and change. Which my Husband was good with that. He knows that's my one guilty pleasure.  Our daughter lucked out because her Birthday was the day after the sale started- I gifted her with the Boardwalk Taffy(the set) - I bought one of those for me as well. The cucumber melon has always been one of my favorites.  So it definitely was the first one i picked up. Looking forward to the next Semi-annual sale,  but i will certainly be there in between the sales ❤❤❤!!!",Bath & Body Works,on Tue,,
